Put in a proot that runs dotnet as a reference here.

Then download osu!lazer (https://github.com/ppy/osu) and build it

Download some more libraries as we are still missing some.

https://github.com/veldrid/veldrid-spirv

This is a pain in the ass to build, so I'll leave the binaries here

https://github.com/shiumano/osu-in-termux/releases/download/v0/libveldrid-spirv.so

Put this in /usr/lib

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbass

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbassmix

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbass_fx

The great AUR has pre-built binaries of these three, so be thankful to use them!

You'll find the zip at the bottom of the Package Details box.

Unzip it and put the one in aarch64 into /usr/lib.

You should be able to start it now.

It's better to use zink if you can.

virgl is usable but it's laggy

# Bugs and problems that occur
